Question 1: Database Credentials In Git

Description: The objective is to create a piece of code that accepts a folder as an input, traverses and finds possible occurances of database credentials in only text or code files.

Solution:
This problem is a query search based problem. We need to open code files and find if the particular keywords or terms are present, if so , 
print them with the line numbers.
We used recursive search , since there could be files , in sub folders which need to be sarched.
We created UI based solution , so you need to enter the path of the folder you want to search. 
Next you need to select the type of files (like .c , .cpp , .java etc) you want to search.
Next if you press the fetch results. You will get the respective file names and the db commands present in that file.


Sample testing and results are uploaded as images in the repository.
