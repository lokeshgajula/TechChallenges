This problem is a query search based problem. We need to open code files and find if the particular keywords or terms are present, if so , 
print them with the line numbers.
We used recursive search , since there could be files , in sub folders which need to be sarched.
We created UI based solution , so you need to enter the path of the folder you want to search. 
Next you need to select the type of files (like .c , .cpp , .java etc) you want to search.
Next if you press the fetch results. You will get the respective file names and the db commands present in that file.
